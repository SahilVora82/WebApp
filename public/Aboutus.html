            <figcaption>I am Rohan Sareen, a 15-year-old sophomore currently attending Staples High School. My interests include software and mechanical engineering, golf, running, and skiing. I am a Certified SolidWorks Associate (CSWA) for mechanical engineering. I am using that experience to start a non-profit project with my local library to engineer low-cost solar-powered lanterns to donate to homeless citizens in the greater Norwalk area. I am now learning more about software engineering to create Neighborly Networks in hopes of helping those who are sick get the items they need. In school, I am the Head of Engineering for our very own Sikorsky STEM club where we compete every year in a state-wide engineering competition hosted by the Sikorsky Lockheed Martin agency. I am also the Vice President for E-Nable 3D in which we 3D print free prosthetic limbs for amputees who cannot afford a medical-grade prosthetic.</figcaption>
